Use code with caution. Learn more
This code will create a simple form with the following fields:

Name
Email
Student ID
Date of Birth
The form will be submitted to the /submit URL using the POST method.

To add more fields to the form, you can simply add more label and input elements. For example, you could add a field for the student's major, or a field for their GPA.

To style the form, you can use CSS. For example, you could add a background color to the form, or you could change the font size of the labels.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
